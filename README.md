### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile, I'm a student at the University of Nottingham, studying for an MSci in Computer Science. 

I love developing, especially in C# and C++, some of my most popular projects include my live miniature departure board project for the Raspberry Pi and a free educational program to teach and test the topic of Mathematical Transformations! I'm also a bit of a transport nerd, so have quite a few projects working with the Reading Buses API ðŸšŒ.
